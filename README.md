# Password Manager

This is a password manager built in Rails 7. This is my first time playing around with the new model-level encryption.

Tech Stack
CSS: tailwind
Database: Postgresql
Ruby: 3.2.2
User: Devise

The problem solved with this app is to be able to share passwords, so many-to-many for both user and password instead of the usual one-to-many

<!-- [GoRails tutorial](gorails.com) -->
  <!-- ## Run locally
  Clone Repo
  ```
  ```
 
  Change to that directory (if renamed in previous step, obviously use that name)
  ```
  cd password_manager
  ```

Install dependencies
```
bundle
```

Create database and run migrations
```
rails db:create && 
``` -->

To start up server + tailwind HMR: 

  ```
  bin/dev
  ```
