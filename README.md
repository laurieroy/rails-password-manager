# Password Manager

This is a password manager built in Rails 7. This is my first time playing around with the new model-level encryption.

Tech Stack
CSS: tailwind
Database: Postgresql
Ruby: 3.2.2
User: Devise

The problem solved with this app is to be able to share passwords, so many-to-many for both user and password instead of the usual one-to-many
